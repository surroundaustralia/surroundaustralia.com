### Focus on data, not systems

The smarter your data, the dumber your software can be!

All [our products](/products) implement [Semantic Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web) technology which we think is the most powerful form of data modelling and data connection available. 

With Semantically-enhanced data, you can see powerful outcomes with simple software since there's more information within the data and thus less work for processing to do to generate insights.

We use various forms of [Machine Learning (ML)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) on top of our Semantic data BUT, we don't just try and push fancey ML systems, we enhance customers' data to make it even smarter. We can include patterns identified by machines that humans might not be able to see right back in the data thus making the patterns human-visible fir future use. Our systems, with human guidance, can enhance data to indicate the relative value of parts of it for tasks such as data classification, sorting and so on.

### Partner with Open Source

In addition to the power of Semantic Web models, given they are open standards, their use ensures organisational "data sovereignty": organisations own, and should be in full control of their data. When organisations don't use standard data models, they may lock themselves in to having to use certain opaque systems in order to interpret their data, thus they can ceed their sovereignty to vendors.

To assist with organisations using semantic data, SURROUND actively developes many Open Source tools:
