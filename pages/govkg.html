<h1>Gov Knowledge Graph</h1>
<p>GovKG is a data product built and managed by SURROUND. It contains multiple pieces of information about government; its structure, the functions it performs and capacity.</p>
<p>It is a single <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science)">knowledge graph</a></em> - that is, the data and definitions in it are in the form of a cohesive <em>ontology</em> and are all bundled together. In this form, all of its parts can be used together and, since our <a href="/sop">SOP platform</a> that it's buit on provides the ability to select individual elements for use, any parts can be included or excluded as desired.</p>
<h5>Which government?</h5>
<p>GovKG started with Australian federal government data but it's been extended to include Australian state, local council info and some New Zealand government information. Since it's an extensible knowledge graph, it can be extended infinitely. We'll keep extending it as required in the areas of governments, government structures, taxonomies of government functions and important 'numerical' data that can be used with it, such as departmental finances.</p>
<p>It also includes several international taxonomies of government functions used by the OECD &amp; UN.</p>
<h5>Extensions for you</h5>
<p>If you like the idea of GovKG and would like it extended for your particular government or scenario, please just <a href="/contact">Contact Us</a>! It's almost certainly possible to accomodate your requirements since extension's the name of the game for this sort of data product.</p>

        <h3>Use Cases</h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">We can demonstrate a number of Use Cases with the GovKG and describe the User Stories that motivate them. Here are just a couple of generic Use Cases to indicate the sorts of things that can be done.</p>
    </div>
    <div style="grid-row:2; grid-column:2;">
        <h4>Reapportionment</h4>
        <p>GovKG can be used to <em>reapportion</em> numerical data, that is, to transform data presented in one structure to another.</p>
        <p>For example, perhaps you have budgets per department/agency and you wish to <em>reapportion</em> that to see what budgets look like per <em>function</em> of government with functions listed in one of the GovKG vocabularies.</p>
        <p>GovKG can help you do this almost instantaneously!</p>
        <h4>Structural Change Modelling</h4>
        <p>Perhaps you want to estimate what the structural makeup of government would look like after some change to budgets per function, as might occur after a new Administrative Arrangement Order has been issued. This can be done by changing the weights of budgets or staffing levels per function and then converting values from function to structure.</p>
        <p><strong>GovKG not only includes government structures and functions and links between them but all previously states of government according to AAOs, back to 1901!</strong></p>
        <h4>Other Use Cases</h4>
        <p>We've thought up a series of GovKG Use Cases that are based on our experience with the questions people often ask of government structure and function. Please <a href="/contact">Contact Us</a> if you'd like the full listing.</p>

    <h3>Australian Government Organisations Register</h3>
    <p>AGOR "provides information on the function, composition, origins and other details of Australian Government bodies". It is a dataset maintained by the <a href="https://www.finance.gov.au">Department of Finance</a> and used to power systms such as <a href="https://www.directory.gov.au">directory.gov.au</a>.</p>
    <p>SURROUND has taken AGOR content from <a href="https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-dga-c77cface-69aa-4dd0-b99f-b065dc33c8e6">data.gov.au</a> and used <a href="https://github.com/CSIRO-enviro-informatics/agor-ont">Semantic Web models of AGOR content</a> developed by the <a href="https://research.csiro.au/ei/">CSIRO's Environmental Informatics Team</a> to produce an ever-growing Seamntic Web dataset of AGOR content. Whenever AGOR is updated, we update our Semantic Web version of it so that you can follow AGOR changes over time easily - by using the Knowledge Graph approach.</p>

    <h3>Administrative Arrangement Orders</h3>
    <p>AAOs are change orders issued by the Australian Government to reorganise the Civil Service.</p>
    <p>All AAOs issued since the formation of Australia were processed by CSIRO into a single dataset according to the <a href="https://github.com/CSIRO-enviro-informatics/aao-ont">Administrative Arrangement Orders ontology</a> with data taken from the AAO documents published online by several government departments.</p>
    <p>SURROUND has enhanced the AAOs model and rendering of AAOs data to present this dataset which now links in to other government structural datasets, such as AGO, and government functions, such as AGIFT.</p>

    <h3>Portfolio Budget Statements</h3>
    <p>Portfolio Budget Statements (PBS) a descriptions of government agency budgets, per portfolio.</p>
    <p>They are collated online in document form at <a href="https://www.budget.gov.au">https://www.budget.gov.au</a> and as data at <a href="https://www.data.gov.au/dataset/ds-dga-2fe0ab1a-3161-477a-9175-5c829d80afab/details?q=Budget%20statements">data.gov.au</a>.</p>
    <p>SURROUND has developed a Semantic Web model of PBS content and formulated the PBS data according to it so that it's commensurate with AGOR, AAO and other GovKG datasets.</p>
    <p>This is a <em>longitudinal</em> dataset with multiple PBS issuances over time within it. The last several most recent PBS issuances are already contained in GovKG and we will be adding more - backwards in time.</p>
    <p>Financial figures from this dataset are good examples of data that could be used for reapportionment, according to some of the expected GovKG Use Cases.</p>

    <h3>Commonwealth Records Series Database</h3>
    <p>The CRS Database is a database of government structural content (agencies, organisations etc.) owned and maintained by the <a href="http://naa.gov.au">National Archives of Australia</a>. It is described at the National Archives of Australia's <a href="https://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/SearchNRetrieve/Interface/SearchScreens/AdvSearchMain.aspx">Records Search website</a>.</p>
    <p>The CRS DB was modelled as a Semantic Web dataset by CSIRO in 2018/2019 and SURROUND has filled out the Semantic Web form of the data from the NAA's up-to-date instance of it.</p>
    <p>CRS DB is an excellent longitudinal dataset of government structure: it contains not only changes over time from 1901 to present but also ancestor and successor agency links.</p>
    <p>CRS DB is used by NAA and others to identify the agents (people, agencies, organisations) within government responsible for records generation and, via Record Authorities, the functions of government.</p>

    <h3>Departmental Finances</h3>
    <p>The annual financial statements from departments, accumulated and presented in Semantic Web form.</p>
    <p>SURROUND developed this dataset from publicly available departmental financial statements and using a Financies ontology that we developed.</p>
    <p>Given that this data is now in a single Sematnic Web dataset, it is much easier to query across departments' fiannces, query values over time and to reapportion financial figures according to government functional vocabularies.</p>
    <p>SURROUND will keep adding finances values to this dataset as they become available.</p>

    <h3>Australian Government Interactive Functions Thesaurus</h3>
    <p>The Australian Governments' Interactive Functions Thesaurus (AGIFT) is a three-level hierarchical thesaurus that describes the business functions carried out across Commonwealth, state and local governments in Australia.</p>
    <p>AGIFT is maintained by the <a href="https://www.naa.gov.au">National Archives of Australia</a> and is in wide use among government agencies as a general purpose functional taxonomy for government. AGIFT is published online as a Sematnci Web asset by the NAA, see <a href="http://data.naa.gov.au/def/agift">http://data.naa.gov.au/def/agift</a>. SURROUND has enhanced this asset with some additional semantics to make it more powerful and we have also created several new Linksets that map AGIFT to other taxonomies.</p>
    <p>Several structural datasets within GovGK have their elements  government structural units - annotated with the functions from AGIFT that they perform.</p>
