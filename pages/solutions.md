# Solutions

### Data for Evidence-Based Policy
We give government agencies the ability to trace the effect of policies and legislation on citizen well-being by quantitatively evaluating outcomes.

### Islands of Information
We provide cutting-edge data tools that help organisations to comprehend and manage their own vast, and sometimes siloed, knowledge base.

### Advanced Analytics Capability
Currently, public sector agencies struggle to manage change in a complex, inter-connected environment, with the limited available analysis tools to provide rapid and accurate impact assessment. Our advanced analytics capability includes complex modelling and predictive analytics.

### Savings
Not only do we provide business intelligence and integration tools, our unique product suite will allow agencies to realise significant savings while increasing existing capabilities.

### Revenue
As knowledge is linked and governed in the enterprise knowledge graph the ability to navigate liked knowledge is realised. New views and new observer viewpoints expose opportunity for new revenue models. The ability to link external knowledge to enterprise knowledge delivers new contextual views and broadens understanding of the marketplace.
