*Illumin* is SURROUND's implementation of a [Knowledge-as-a-Service (Kaas)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_as_a_service) service!

SURROUND has pioneered some aspects of KaaS application, so [visit SURROUND's KaaS page](/kaas) for more info than Wikipedia.

         such as Finance (FinKG), Government (GovKG) or the resources sector (ResKG), just as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_as_a_service">Data as a Service</a> does. It also accesses a <em>Reference Data Source</em> which consists of general data models, background datasets and perhaps streaming information to provide <em>context</em> to the information delivered, turning it into <em><strong>knowledge</strong></em>.</p>
