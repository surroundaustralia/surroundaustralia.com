## BRII Auto-Sentencing Feasibility Study
The [National Archives of Australia (NAA)](http://www.naa.gov.au) is the Australian federal government's agency that collects records of Australian government decisions and actions. They do this to connect Australians with the nation's memory, their identity and history. 

Government agencies have to determine the business purpose of all their electronic records and then transfer those of the highest importance to the NAA. Deciding what is important and what is not can sometimes be difficult. Although for some documents this is obvious, e.g. a ministerial briefing is likely important, what about the very many non-trivial emails, spreadsheets, reports and even data objects?

SURROUND work on a Feasibility study for NAA in late 2019 to determine how feasible it would be to classify very large volumes of records automatically. If automation isn't achieved eventually, government agencies will either have to send the NAA everything or nothing - they just won't be able to make sensible decisions.

SURROUND built the prototype for the [SORT Robot](/sort) to answer this challenge.

## Geoscience Data Mondernisation Programme
The [Geological Survey of Queensland (GSQ)](https://www.business.qld.gov.au/industries/mining-energy-water/resources/geoscience-information/gsq) undertook a major project to update all of their data systems and processes to allow the resources sector to gain greater benefits from the information its contain. This involved deprecating legacy databases and data stores, moving data and tools to the cloud and considering holistic approaches to the agency's total data holdings.

SURROUND was engaged to provide strategic direction for GSQ regarding data governance and management.

SURROUND staff responded with implementing both an overarching formal data modelling approach for the agency to quality assure data transfer from old to new systems and also principles for, and some design of, new data systems themselves.

GSQ has now "semantically enabled" much of their data and is on track to delivering a wide range of data products that, for the first time, are able to be integrated across systems and data themes due to the overarching data modelling.

## Access Canberra Program
The Australian Capital Territory Government's Access Canberra initiative highlights the issues and opportunities created by the islands of information present in the Big Data and semantic world.

The multitude of islands make it extremely difficult to deliver public services in a citizen-driven context where operational decisions are compromised through a complete lack of holistic situational data.

Operational decisions are compromised through a lack of complete situational data and the information needed to do strategic service and resource planning is often out of date before it can be assembled.

Access Canberra strives not to centralise data or even bring under central control but to make it accessible and exploitable for improved service design and delivery based on both citizen and community benefit value - that is, evidence based policy.

Unlike Enterprise Information and Knowledge Management Systems, Surround is an Enterprise Information Exploitation Capability (EIEC) closely coupled to the enterprise's purpose.
